### Features
- Meditate whilst seeing the world around you.
- Seamless camera transitions from exploration to Meditation and back.
- Supports both Default and Close exploration camera settings.
- New appear animation for the Meditation UI.
- The Meditation UI includes a prompt to open the Alchemy menu.
- Open the Alchemy menu during Meditation to brew potions, oils etc.
- Crafting an Alchemy item advances the game time by 15 minutes.
- Alchemy is prohibited outside of Meditation or a herbalist, though you can still access the menu at any time.
- Quest items can always be crafted, even outside of Meditation or a herbalist, and do not advance time.
- Full support for the Corvo Bianco bed, with minor UI tweaks and unchanged functionality.
- The Corvo Bianco Alchemy Table works as normal.
- When in the wilderness Geralt will light a campfire when starting meditating, and put it out when stopping.
- Supports both gamepad and keyboard.

### Compatibility
- Incompatible with other similar mods, including Friendly Meditation, Preparations and Immersive Meditation. This mod aims to achieve similar things to these great mods in subtly different ways, and is intended as an alternative to them.
- Incompatible with UI replacers (E3 UI & Hud, Vladimir UI etc.)
- Compatible with Simple Alchemy Refill (Brew With A View was made with this mod in mind, and I think the combination is great, that being said, it's not required, just highly recommended).
- Compatible with Swords and Meditation (another highly recommended combination, this will add Geralt's swords, crossbow and misc Alchemy items around the campfire, and really adds to that sense of preparation. Note: my mod will sometimes not spawn a campfire e.g. in an interior. However, Swords and Meditation will always spawn the items. So sometimes you will have items and no campfire when using these mods together. This isn't a major issue, and looks fine in my opinion, but is something to be aware of.)
- Compatible with Brothers In Arms (probably the only must have mod!).
- Compatible with font replacers.
- Compatible with Smooth GUI (highly recommended). Just let this mod win any .redswf conflicts. I haven't made any changes to Meditatiion UI animation speeds to match Smooth GUI, but from playtesting it didn't feel like it needed anything. Please let me know if I missed something.
- This mod makes use of script annotations to reduce merge conflicts, but you should still always run Script Merger!

### Installation
- Install like any other mod. The Tome of Witcher 3 Modding is a great place to start if you are new to the process.
- Run Script Merger to ensure this mod's changes aren't overwritten.

### Technical
- The mod was formerly known as Alchemy Requires Meditation, the REDkit project retains this name and is frequently referenced in the project files.
- If you are looking for my changes inside .ws or .as files, search for "modcrab".
