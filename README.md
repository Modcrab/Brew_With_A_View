# Alchemy Requires Meditation
 
- Meditate in realtime.
- Pause during meditation to do alchemy.
- Alchemy is prohibited outside of meditation or a herbalist, though you can still access the menu at any time.
- Crafting an alchemy item advances the game time by 15 minutes.
- Quest items can always be crafted, even outside of meditation or a herbalist, and do not advance time.
- Corvo Bianco bed functionality remains unchanged.
- Includes meditation clock UI fixes.
- Meditation UI is extended to include a prompt to open the alchemy menu. The prompt is greyed out whilst advacing time. The prompt doesn't show when sleeping in Corvo Bianco.
