dev:
- add Russian translation from Arkwulf
- add Hungarian translation from Gergo900410
- add camera presets (default, immersive camera style)
- replace unlocalized languages with English to avoid empty text
- pressing N during meditation could bring you out of meditation mode

bugs:
- (Minor) the alchemy tutorial is not completable if you open alchemy outside of meditation
- (Minor) the alchemy prompt loses the square braces: "the alchemy prompt hotkey will lose its [] bracket after meditation. It's a keyboard thing. So when entering the meditation menu initially, the hotkey of alchemy is like this: [L] Alchemy, but after a meditation, it becomes this: L Alchemy."
- (Normal) opening the inventory during meditation with "I", and switching tabs, sooner or later will enter meditation and close the menu

future:
- improve feet sliding on stand up animation
- fix geralt sometimes standing bolt upright when exiting meditation
- see if there is a better way to manage the alchemy menu input
- disable meditation in common menu when CanMeditateHere will fail?

tests:
- 

publish:
- ensure bin file has been added
- archive bundle without intermediary folder, e.g. "Bin" and "Mods" should be at the top level under the archive
