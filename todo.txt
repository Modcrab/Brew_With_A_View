dev 1.5:
- patch for Preparations
- (Normal) check health regeneration is computed via in-game time not real-time
- (Normal) allow using photo mode
- (Minor) the alchemy tutorial is not completable if you open alchemy outside of meditation
- (Minor) if you press N + M, or N + I, at the same time, the map opens, with no bg menu, and when you close it, you are meditating
- (Minor) fix hardcoded canCookStatus == 6
- (Minor) rest menu could have an appear animation?

dev 1.6:
- add Arabic localization from sha6er1980 - pending

future:
- improve feet sliding on stand up animation
- fix geralt sometimes standing bolt upright when exiting meditation
- disable meditation in common menu when CanMeditateHere will fail?
- see if we can make HUD fade back in not snap
- Menu option to alter the speed of time during meditation - I find the vanilla 'fast forward' a bit jarring for such an immersive scene.
- don't spawn campfire if there is one nearby
- force holster torch when meditating

tests:
- 

publish:
