dev:
- improve camera positioning
- edit menu to include open alchemy menu icon
- strip code down/simplify code
- move code into annotations
- when exiting rapidly, the campfire visibly desyncs from the animation, not a biggy but nice to improve
- can we speed up exiting during combat any more

future:
- check compatibility with SAM

publish:
- create feature list in read me
- add SAR as a highly recommended mod
