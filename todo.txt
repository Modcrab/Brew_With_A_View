dev:
- add camera presets (default, immersive camera style)
- add Arabic localization from sha6er1980
- Hungarian loc tweaks from blupatrik
- Polish loc from PLKaratusPL and shogo87
- add Portuguese Brazilian loc from Sakatsuky
- patch for Refill Alchemy Items Without Meditation for user AeronightV
- patch for Preparations
- check diffs
- sfx for new confirm intent
- update smoke test for new features
- check entering meditation state is working assumed

bugs:
- (Minor) the alchemy tutorial is not completable if you open alchemy outside of meditation
- (Minor) the alchemy prompt loses the square braces: "the alchemy prompt hotkey will lose its [] bracket after meditation. It's a keyboard thing. So when entering the meditation menu initially, the hotkey of alchemy is like this: [L] Alchemy, but after a meditation, it becomes this: L Alchemy."
- (Normal) opening the inventory during meditation with "I", and switching tabs, sooner or later will enter meditation and close the menu
- (Critical) you are stuck after using Corvo Bianco bed, likely due to common menu meditation mode removal

future:
- improve feet sliding on stand up animation
- fix geralt sometimes standing bolt upright when exiting meditation
- see if there is a better way to manage the alchemy menu input
- disable meditation in common menu when CanMeditateHere will fail?

tests:
- 

publish:
- ensure bin file has been added
- archive bundle without intermediary folder, e.g. "Bin" and "Mods" should be at the top level under the archive
